# Tensorflow Playground

This repository serves as demonstration of tensorflow model implementations and ML concepts in the form of different
experiments. A series of base classes are additionally provided in order to facilitate each experiment and generify the
training process. An explanation of each experiment is provided below.

-  [**Classifier Experiments**](classifier_experiment/README.md)

The classifier experiments are based off of Tensorflow's documentation
found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification). In this experiment we implement a model that
classifies images into different classes for two datasets: Fashion MNIST and MNIST. Once these models were trained, they
were evaluated with the test dataset provided by Tensorflow and a small custom dataset I compiled myself for each. The
results from these two datasets are compared and analyzed.
