# Tensorflow Playground

This repository serves as demonstration of tensorflow model implementations and ML concepts in the form of different
experiments. A series of base classes are additionally provided in order to facilitate each experiment and generify the
training process. An explanation of each experiment is provided below.

-  [**Classifier Experiments**](classifier_experiment/README.md)

The classifier experiment is based off of Tensorflow's documentation
found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification). In this experiment we implement a model that
classifies images into 1 of 10 different classes of clothing. The framework I provide gives the user access to a number
of configurability options that allow us to easily modify the training process. Additionally, I compiled a few custom
images myself to be used in the evaluation process.
